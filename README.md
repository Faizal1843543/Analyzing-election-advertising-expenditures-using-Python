Analyzing 2024 Indian election ad spending on Facebook and Instagram, exploring its impact on voting patterns using Python.

If you're a frequent user of Facebook and Instagram, you've likely encountered election ads from various political parties, particularly BJP and INC. Political parties in India typically invest heavily in election campaigns. Recently, I gathered data from Meta ads detailing the expenditure on Instagram and Facebook ads by each political party during the 2024 Indian elections across states. This article conducts an analysis of election ad spending using Python and explores its impact on voting patterns.

The dataset I've compiled comprises three files:

1. The Advertisers Dataset offers insights into which pages (parties or organizations) invest in election ads and their ad volume.
2. The Locations Dataset reveals spending on ads across different locations, highlighting campaign focus areas.
3. The Results Dataset presents voting data, detailing voter turnout and participation in each area.
